1. ts-playground is commited to this repo as a submodule; repo is available at https://github.com/denniyahh/ts-playground
2. I was able to modify ts-playground to successfully extract main characters from an uploaded .txt document and display it in a text field
3. I was not able to modify the LLM API output to be stored as an array, displayed in a table, and integrated into the Storytelling app
